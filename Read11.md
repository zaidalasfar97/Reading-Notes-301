# What is EJS?
### EJS stand for Embedded JavaScript templates is simple and effective template engine for JavaScript. EJS is the simple template which allows developers to create the HTML page with plain JavaScript. Ejs provide fast compilation and rendering and include both server and browser support.
### The general idea is to send your content to the browser delivered as js, in whatever syntax your chosen js templating engine dictates, once loaded (probably on DOMContentLoaded?) at which point the js template engine will take over and generate the HTML client side.
### EJS make your server less a complicated server side and end up pushing rendering to the client.

# EJS is a framework with a template. In the EJS syntax, you identify HTML pages and decide where different data will go on the list. Your app then blends data with the template and “renders” a full HTML page where the data is taken by EJS and embedded into the web page according to how the template was defined. You could have a complex data table from a database, for instance, and you want EJS to create the data table according to your show rules. It saves you from the drudgery of writing code to create HTML based on data dynamically.
